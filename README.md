# TermProject-WebApp
Created a variable calculator for specified geometry problem given varying inputs.
Like the Gallery-WebApp, this project was hosted over an apache tomcat server to be displayed as a webpage.
The user is able to enter their desired variables, and my program calculates and displays the missing information.
